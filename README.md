# blessed

A curses-like library with a high level terminal interface API for node.js.

Blessed is over 16,000 lines of code and terminal goodness. It's completely
implemented in javascript, and its goal consists of two things:

1. Reimplement ncurses entirely by parsing and compiling terminfo and termcap,
and exposing a `Program` object which can output escape sequences compatible
with _any_ terminal.

2. Implement a widget API which is heavily optimized for terminals.

The blessed renderer makes use of CSR (change-scroll-region), and BCE
(back-color-erase). It draws the screen using the painter's algorithm and is
sped up with smart cursor movements and a screen damage buffer. This means
rendering of your application will be extremely efficient: blessed only draws
the changes (damage) to the screen.

Blessed is arguably as accurate as ncurses, but even more optimized in some
ways. The widget library gives you an API which is reminiscent of the DOM.
Anyone is able to make an awesome terminal application with blessed. There are
terminal widget libraries for other platforms (primarily [python][urwid] and
[perl][curses-ui]), but blessed is possibly the most DOM-like (dare I say the
most user-friendly?).

Blessed has been used to implement other popular libraries and programs.
Examples include: the [slap text editor][slap] and [blessed-contrib][contrib].
The blessed API itself has gone on to inspire [termui][termui] for Go.
